        <p class="attireTextType1">
            Organize your application interface with lightweight javascript view components.
            Works pretty much like a augmented Backbone view with no large dependencies.
            Weighs around 1.5 KB.

            Simple view allows you to delegate or bind events to current element context with a simple declarative syntax.
            Events strings can be dynamically configured with injected variables.
            One time events are configured with simple event string prefix.
            You can listen to window and document events and be sure that all handlers will be cleaned up upon view removal.

            Every instance of simple view can have sub-views and be used as container of views or collection view.
