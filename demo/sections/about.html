        <p class="attireTextType1">
            Organize your application interface with lightweight javascript view components.
            Works pretty much like a augmented Backbone view with no large dependencies.
            Weighs around 1.5 KB.
        </p>

        <p class="attireTextType2">
            Simple view allows you to delegate or bind events to current element context with a simple declarative syntax.
            Event strings can be dynamically configured with injected variables.
            One time events are configured with simple prefix on event string .
            You can listen to window and document events and be sure that all handlers will be cleaned up upon view removal.
        </p>
        <p class="attireTextType2">
            Every Simple view instance can have sub-views and be used as container of views (collection view).
            Controller and component views can be easily composed if that is how you want your application to be structured.
            Choose your view hierarchy as it suits your project needs.
        </p>
        <p class="attireTextType2">
            Simple view works great with server side rendered html.
            There is no requirement for client side templating or rendering of any kind.
        </p>
